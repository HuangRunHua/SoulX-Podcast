   <h1>SoulX-Podcast: Towards Realistic Long-form Podcasts with Dialectal and Paralinguistic Diversity</h1>
<p>

##  Overview
SoulX-Podcast is designed for podcast-style multi-turn, multi-speaker dialogic speech generation, while also achieving superior performance in the conventional monologue TTS task.

To meet the higher naturalness demands of multi-turn spoken dialogue, SoulX-Podcast integrates a range of paralinguistic controls and supports both Mandarin and English, as well as several Chinese dialects, including Sichuanese, Henanese, and Cantonese, enabling more personalized podcast-style speech generation.


## Key Features üî•

- **Long-form, multi-turn, multi-speaker dialogic speech generation**: SoulX-Podcast excels in generating high-quality, natural-sounding dialogic speech for multi-turn, multi-speaker scenarios.

- **Cross-dialectal, zero-shot voice cloning**: SoulX-Podcast supports zero-shot voice cloning across different Chinese dialects, enabling the generation of high-quality, personalized speech in any of the supported dialects.

- **Paralinguistic controls**: SoulX-Podcast supports a variety of paralinguistic events, as as ***laugher*** and ***sighs*** to enhance the realism of synthesized results.
